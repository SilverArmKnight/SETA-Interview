To test the functions in Javascript_algorithm, do the following command.
```
cd Javascript_algorithm
npm test
```

To run the website, do the following command.
```
cd React
cd post_display
npm start
```

The React app uses the old create-react-app instead of npm create vite@latest.
To test adding a new post, insert your input and press 'Post'. The new post
should be appended at the very end of the display. However, if you reload the
page, that new post will disappear. This is because the data is not saved in
any backend.
